The limitation of recipes daily will drive the user to subscribe, allowing them to an unlimited number of recipes. The simplistic website will generate a high number of users due to the easy way of navigation and accessing information and the fact that it contains recipes in Spanish and English would create a more broad number of users.  </p>
